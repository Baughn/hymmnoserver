				<span style="color: red;">
					The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie_hypothesis">de Broglie hypothesis</a>
					and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality">wave-particle duality</a>
					hold that all matter has a wave-like nature. The world of Ar tonelico takes some liberties
					with advancing and departing from the physics behind these concepts, so just accept that
					what is presented is a reasonable translation of Akira Tsuchiya's transcribed imaginings
					and <b>not</b> material that should go on your next term paper.

			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos is based on a number of abstract, complex concepts.
				This page briefly explains the concepts needed to understand the terms used throughout
				the rest of this site, although some of the science described here differs quite
				significantly from what we understand to be the way the world works.
				Considering the dissimilarities between the science behind Hymmnos and that of the real
				world, only the gist of the concepts described here is required to understand the
				nature of the language.<br/>
				These terms all appear in the Ar tonelico games, so you may find it easier to understand
				their nature after you have played them.

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Dynamic waves</div>
				<p>
					A dynamic wave is any type of wave that propagates while maintaining its form. 
					As sound, the waves that carry Hymmnos Words need to travel to have any
					effect on the world; just like heat, light, and every other type of waveform,
					the magic waves of Hymmnos are conducted through matter.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Static waves</div>
				<p>
					Static waves are a somewhat more complicated concept.
					Using an arbitrary example -- and, really, there can be no non-arbitrary examples here --
					consider a pencil. For it to continue to be a pencil, the forces that keep it coherent
					must maintain a certain balance; effectively, the forces of the universe have gathered
					tiny components that have coalesced into something we recognize as a pencil.
					These forces, and, indeed, the matter that they act upon, can be expressed as waves, and
					it is the interaction all of these waves that form the static wave structure we
					perceive as a pencil.
				</p>
				<p>
					Akira Tsuchiya, the expert on Hymmnos theory, offers this analogy for those with a
					background in physics: static waves are like a collection of atoms. Normally,
					individual atoms scatter throughout their environment, but when enough start to bind to
					each other, stable molecules form. Static waves are like molecules in that they do not
					disperse on their own, remaining stable until acted on by an outside force.
				</p>

			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">D-wave</div>
				<p>
					Matter-waves are referred to as &quot;<b>D</b>etail-waves&quot;.<br/>
					Take, for example, metals.
					Differences can be observed as the frequencies acting on them vary between 0Hz and ∞Hz --
					these differences are not reflected directly in terms of their fundamental shape, but
					rather through physical phenomena, such as melting because of high temperatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					The terms &quot;dynamic wave&quot; and &quot;static wave&quot; are often used to describe
					D-waves; these terms are typically interchangeable with &quot;dynamic D-wave&quot; and
					&quot;static D-wave&quot;. The rough relationship between them is that dynamic
					D-waves affect static D-waves, like exciting the particles in water to cause it
					to boil.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">H-wave</div>
				<p>
					Thought-waves are referred to as &quot;<b>H</b>ymmno-waves&quot;.<br/>
					These waves cannot be explained through analogies related to physical matter; they are,
					in essence, waves that carry feelings and the intent of thoughts.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				D-waves and H-waves are transmitted via entirely different spectra, so they do not interfere
				with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				At present, the researchers of Sol Ciel have not been able to prove that D-waves and H-waves
				exist alone. With the infinite range of wave-spectra, an infinite number of wave-type
				varieties may exist.
