			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ The history of Hymmnos and its dialects</div>
			<p>
				The origins of Hymmnos and the Hymmnos script are ancient, existing even before the father of
				Sound Science discovered Sound Magic in the First Era.
				Though not called Hymmnos at the time, the chants common to the shamans,
				called Tsukikanade (Moon Chanters), laid the foundations for the language that was to emerge.
				<br/><br/>
				Deriving from the grammar and phonetics of the shamans' chants, Hymmnos was formalized as a
				language optimized for controlling and communicating with Towers.
				<br/><br/>
				The original Hymmnos language that spread across the world underwent subtle changes depending on the
				region and sect in which it was used, and the language's lexicon steadily evolved.
				Because of this evolutionary process, Hymmnos features dialects and archaisms, just like English,
				Japanese, and every other living language in the contemporary world.
			</p>
			Hymmnos dialects found in the Third Era:
			<ul class="basic-inline" style="font-size: 9pt;">
				<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Central Standard Note</span> (Standard)</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cult Ciel Note</span> (Ancient language from before the First Era)</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cluster Note</span> (Cluster Area Language)</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alpha Note</span> (Origin Spell)</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ancient Metafalss Note</span> (Sacred language from the First Era)</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Testament of Pastalie</span> (Pastalie Dialect) </li>
			</ul><br/>
		</div>
		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Central Standard Note</div>
			<p>
				&quot;Central&quot; refers to the first Tower, Ar tonelico, considered the core of Song Magic
				in the First Era.
				Because of this, the chants optimized for controlling Towers are the domain of Central Standard Note.
				However, this does not mean that control chants are limited to Central Standard Note; any dialect can
				be home to chants that control Towers, but they are generally not optimal.
				Central Standard Note is, effectively, a standardized, prescriptive form of Hymmnos, agreed upon by
				the Tower administration in Sol Ciel's capital, El Elemia, not unlike the ISO standards in use
				on Earth in the 20th and 21st centuries.
			</p>
			<p>
				The nature of this standardization is such that anything accepted from any dialect becomes part of
				Central Standard Note, meaning that queries and access requests are expressed in a standardized manner.
				Because of this evolutionary design, it is not uncommon to find Central Standard Note used in conjunction
				with other dialects. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Cult Ciel Note</div>
			<p>
				Cult Ciel Note is a more streamlined form of the chants of the Tsukikanade, the shamans whose
				grammar and phonetics formed the basis of Hymmnos.
				As a dialect, it is largely unused in modern communication and it is, essentially, dead.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Cluster Note</div>
			<p>
				Originating in the First Era, in the Sol Cluster region -- an area far-removed from the Sol Ciel region, which
				is on the other side of the planet -- Cluster Note evolved.
				Relative to Central Standard Note, Cluster Note is like a dialect, but its effects
				(<i>in terms of its capacity for controlling Towers</i> -ed) are virtually identical.
				At present, none in the lands of Ar tonelico can make use of Cluster Note, but it is possible that,
				somewhere in the world, a settlement exists, based around this dialect.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Alpha Note</div>
			<p>
				Origin Reyvateils, only three of which are known to exist, can construct optimized Hymmnos by themselves.
				The Hymmnos they generate belong to the Alpha Note dialect.
				<br/><br/>
				Alpha Note is limited in that it cannot yield practical results if it is not used in conjunction
				with the Tower managed by the Origin that created it.
				<br/><br/>
				This is because, unlike how the other dialects are collections of Hymmnos derived from current language
				specifications (Reyvateils speaking these dialects can construct novel phrases using pre-defined Hymmnos,
				much like how humans form sentences), Alpha Note binds new Hymmnos to an extension of a Tower's functionality.
				Summarized, this means that only the Origin's Tower can interpret the Alpha Note Hymmnos she has defined,
				making it useless in the domain of other Towers; for this reason, Alpha Note is not a general-purpose dialect
				but a class of dialects.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Ancient Metafalss Note</div>
			<p>
				A unique dialect originating in the early days of the First Era in the holy land of Metafalss, which
				held dominion over the world in the third millennium.
				<br/><br/>
				The power conveyed by a single Word of this dialect far exceeds that of the average Word found in
				Central Standard Note.
				<br/><br/>
				The motivations behind the fabrication of such strong Hymmnos rests in the beliefs of the society of
				Metafalss: in their land, spiritual ideology flourished much moreso than in any other region,
				and, as praise for the Tsukikanade, extensive effort was invested in the research and development
				of chants.
				Because of this, even as other regions were reaching the limits of what could be accomplished through
				conventional Song Magic, the people of Metafalss slowly overcame these limits, learning how to
				craft still-stronger chants, then refining and improving them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether fortunate or not, because of their devotion to spiritual ideology, while other regions shifted the
				focus of their studies to science and discovered the significance of intonation and emotions in chants, the
				ways of the Tsukikanade continued to dominate the people of Metafalss, and their civilization's power rapidly
				declined in the fourth millennium.
				Ultimately, because of their standing, though weakened, political position with Sol Ciel, the words of
				Metafalss Note came to be registered in the Song Magic servers.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ New Testament of Pastalie</div>
			<p>
				This is a new dialect that was created in the lands of Metafalss around 3400, specifically intended for
				use with Infel Phira, an entirely different Song Magic Server from Ar tonelico; only the I.P.D.s
				(Infel Phira Dependencies), the Reyvateil connected to Infel Phira, are able to use it.
				Because of its unique characteristics, its compatibility with other dialects is virtually nil, in
				terms of everything from its grammar through its lexicon.
				The manner by which commands are invoked has also changed, from &quot;EXEC_XXXX/.&quot; to
				&quot;METHOD_XXXX/.&quot;; in practice, however, emulation bridges allow for the support of other
				access methods: they are internally translated into statements in the New Testament, but the user may
				employ Hymmnos defined in, for example, Central Standard Note without modification.
			</p>
			<p>
				The grammar of the New Testament is dramatically different from that of other Hymmnos originating from the
				First Era, so those interested in the Hymmnos language itself should learn
				<a href="./grammar2.php">its specific grammar</a>, as well.
