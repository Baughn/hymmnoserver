				<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Types of Hymmnos Words</div><br/>
				There are three forms of Hymmnos:
			</p>
			<ul class="basic-inline" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 9pt;">
				<li>Hymmnos Extract</li>
				<li>Hymmnos Words</li>
				<li>Hymmnos Spells</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Extract is a name for the chants that control Towers.
				It is this branch of Hymmnos that has the power to directly control Ar_tonelico.
				However, this power generally requires authorization before a Reyvateil can make use of it;
				this authorization is typically granted based on a Reyvateil's Hymn Code
				(note: third-generation Reyvateils do not have Hymn Codes, though they are still connected
				to towers).
				For example, the Hymn Code &quot;EOLIA_ANSUL_ARTONELICO&quot;, which belongs to a β Reyvateil,
				grants authorization for Hymmnos Extracts that range from gravity manipulation to weather control,
				earthquakes to environmental orchestration, magical chant dampening and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Words, casually known as "magical chants", are mainly used for everyday tasks and combat.
				These are formed from the richness of a Reyvateil's heart, which makes them highly versatile.
				As a Reyvateil allows more feelings and emotions to flow through her heart, the possible variations
				of Hymmnos Words increase, making this a Hymmnos branch with limitless potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Spells are chants that, instead of drawing from a Reyvateil's heart, make use of pre-existing
				Hymmnos strings, like Hymmnos Extract; these grant Reyvateil access to powers normally beyond them.
				The majority of Hymmnos Spells are used for authentication and interaction with towers.
				<br/>
				Grammatically, Hymmnos Spells are identical to Hymmnos Words. the difference is that Hymmnos Spells
				are registered with a tower, so they have a predefined function. Intuitively, it follows that new
				Hymmnos Spells cannot be created by individual Reyveteils on-the-fly because those would be Hymmnos Words.

			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Hymmnos theory</div>
			<p>
				This section attempts to explain the logic behind each type of Hymmnos.
			</p>
			<p>
				While it may seem as though all three branches of Hymmnos are fundamentally the same:
				speak a chant -> something happens, there are significant differences
				between them. For example, as noted above, the origin of each chant is different:
				Hymmnos Words are entirely dependent on the Reyvateil, while the other branches draw
				from prescriptive sources; because of this, the effects of non-Hymmnos Word chants
				largely rely on inorganic constructs.

					A Hymn Crystal powering a Reyvateil's H-waves that cause a tower to react,
					and a Reyvateil using H-waves to cause a tower to emit a D-wave to do
					something elsewhere in the world.

				Those familiar with Hymmnos theory may have realized that Hymmnos Extract does not always
				reflect any emotional desires within the Reyveteil using it. Though it employs conducted
				H-waves,	these	waves carry only a clear, plain message that tells the Tower to intervene.

				In all cases, the H-waves of a Reyvateil should be able to reach their destination,
				carrying the collected thoughts of the Reyvateil.<br/>
				(However, this does not mean that the chant will always result in	exactly what the Reyvateil wants,
				particularly if the Reyvateil does not feel confident in the chant she sang)
			</p>
			<p>
				The most difficult Hymmnos Extracts to use are also the most uncomfortable for the
				Reyvateil to accept, as the feelings with which they were designed are conveyed
				directly to the receipient. If the Reyvateil cannot handle the feelings, she may
				be entirely unable to use the Hymmnos Extract.<br/>
				To overcome this, &quot;stories&quot; (<i>artificial memories? false love?</i>) are used
				as a form of shock-absorber, to allow a Reyvateil to download Hymmnos Extracts.
				This is often the fastest way to encourage compatibility between a Reyvateil and a foreign program.
				When downloading, if there is still a conflict between the Reyvateil and the Hymmnos Extract,
				the Reyvateil may refuse to allow the download to complete, or the downloaded program may be
				unusable.

		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ The design of Hymmnos Extract</div>
			<p>
				EXEC_PAJA/. is a chant defined by a Tower that runs a function of the system; it is
				conveyed using a Reyvateil's feelings (H-waves).
				Technically, the Hymmnos chant was downloaded (memorized) and the Reyvateil (daughter) 
				sang it.
				What the Reyvateil has done is much the same as how a device controller reads the data
				from a DVD.
				To explain this in more technical terms, the Reyvateil's song, which sent a message via
				the wave-spectrum of her feelings (H-waves), was generated by a CPU that used a bus to
				access her memory, allowing for control over things like the bandwidth and resolution
				of the retrieved data (<i>which, perhaps, accounts for differences between identical
				Hymmnos Extracts sung by different Reyvateils</i>).
				A table that summarizes this relationship is presented below.

				Expressed in terms of real-world technology, H-waves are like program instructions, and
				D-waves are used to show the results on a screen.

		<div class="text-basic">
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ The relationship between conducted H-waves</div>
			<p>
				The H-waves associated with Hymmnos Words, in some cases, can be effective, even without
				the assistance of a Tower; the conscious and unconscious powers of a Reyvateil may be
				sufficient to yeild results.
				In such cases, the powers of the Reyvateil herself limit the force of her Hymmnos Words.
				However, Hymmnos Extracts always require the presence of a tower.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Extract relies on foreign feelings, which denies the singer the ability to use
				her own discretion to control the flow of H-waves.
				This is best explained by contrast: consider the Hymmnos Word EXEC_HYMME_LIFE_A:W:S/.,
				as sung by Aurica; when she begins, she unconsciously determines the spectrum and flow
				of the H-waves she emits. However, when she sang the Hymmnos Extract EXEC_LINCA/.,
				the H-wave flow required to establish the connection was pre-determined and, therefore,
				beyond her control.
				As seen in this example, Hymmnos Extract requires only capabilities of appropriate flow
				and specturm from a Reyvateil.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, these demands have the potential for tragedy: it should be apparent that
				Hymmnos Extract places extreme demands upon the powers of a Reyvateil, much moreso than
				any other form of invoked Hymmnos.
				The second generation of Reyvateils had virtually no problems meeting the demands of these
				chants: being, fundamentally, clones of the Origin, their powers all met identical minumum
				standards, allowing for the neat separation of Hymmnos Extract into two categories:
				Origin-exclusive and general-purpose for those of "pure beta blood".
				(Note: Origins from successive eras are bred to have specifications virtually identical to
				those of their predecessors, avoiding problems)
				The problem arises with the third generation, which offers no minimum guarantees regarding
				abilities. Because of this, those of the third generation who would attempt to invoke
				Hymmnos Extract would likely die under the stress of the demands.
			</p>
			<p>
				As ironic fortune, the fact that the third generation lacks Hymn Codes prevents them from
				using the more dangerous Hymmnos Extracts.
