			<p>
				There are three forms of Hymmnos:
			</p>
			<ul class="basic-inline" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 9pt;">
				<li>Hymmnos Extract</li>
				<li>Hymmnos Words</li>
				<li>Hymmnos Spells</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Extract is a name for the chants that control Towers.
				It is this branch of Hymmnos that has the power to directly control Ar_tonelico.
				However, this power generally requires authorization before a Reyvateil can make use of it;
				this authorization is typically granted based on a Reyvateil's &quot;Hymn Code&quot;
				(note: third-generation Reyvateils do not have Hymn Codes, though they are still connected
				to towers).
				An example Hymn Code is &quot;EOLIA_ANSUL_ARTONELICO&quot;; it uniquely identifies a specific β
				Reyvateil.
				Reyvateils with access to Hymmnos Extract may perform great feats ranging from gravity manipulation
				to weather control, earthquakes to environmental orchestration, and much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Words, informally known in the Third Era as &quot;Song Magic&quot;, are mainly used for everyday
				tasks and combat.
				These are formed from the richness of a Reyvateil's heart, which makes them highly versatile.
				As a Reyvateil allows more feelings and emotions to flow through her heart, the possible variations
				of Hymmnos Words increase, making this a Hymmnos branch with limitless potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Spells are chants that, instead of drawing form from a Reyvateil's heart, make use of
				pre-defined Hymmnos strings, much like Hymmnos Extracts.
				This fixed nature leads to one of the most significant features of this branch of Hymmnos: it can be
				used by humans, not just Reyvateils.
				Accordingly, the majority of Hymmnos Spells exist as a means of authentication and interaction with Towers.
				<br/>
				Grammatically, Hymmnos Spells are identical to Hymmnos Words. the difference is that Hymmnos Spells
				are registered with a tower, so they have a pre-defined function. Intuitively, it follows that new
				Hymmnos Spells cannot be created by individuals because they would not be connected to tower functions.

			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Hymmnos theory</div>
			<p>
				This section attempts to explain the logical system of each type of Hymmnos.
			</p>
			<p>
				While it may seem as though all three branches of Hymmnos are fundamentally the same:
				speak a chant -> something happens, there are significant differences
				between them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Spells are different because they are not limited to use by Reyvateils.
				However, the difference between the other two branches is buried deeper in their natures:
				Hymmnos Words are based entirely on an individual Reyvateil's heart and experiences, while
				Hymmnos Extracts are highly structured, inorganic constructs.

				<b>▼ Invoking Hymmnos Extract</b><br/>
				<img src="/hymmnoserver/images/usage.png" alt="A Hymn Crystal seeding a Reyvateil's H-waves, which trigger a reaction in a Tower; and a Reyvateil using H-waves to cause a tower to emit D-waves to accomplish something"/><br/>
				Those familiar with Hymmnos theory may have realized that Hymmnos Extract does not directly
				reflect any emotional desires within the Reyvateil using it. Though it employs H-waves,
				these	waves carry only a clear, plain message that tells the Tower to act.

				In all cases, the H-waves of a Reyvateil should be able to reach their destination,
				carrying her collected thoughts.<br/>
				(However, this does not mean that the chant will always result in	exactly what the Reyvateil wants,
				particularly if the Reyvateil made a mistake, omitted a sentiment, or does not feel confident in
				the chant she sang)
			</p>
			<p>
				The most difficult Hymmnos Extracts to use are also the most uncomfortable for the
				Reyvateil to accept, as the feelings with which they were designed are conveyed
				directly to the recipient. If the Reyvateil cannot handle the feelings, she may
				be entirely unable to use the Hymmnos Extract.<br/>
				To overcome this, &quot;stories&quot; that alter the Reyvateil's emotional state may be
				used as a form of shock-absorber to allow her to download Hymmnos Extracts;
				this is often the fastest way to encourage compatibility between a Reyvateil and a foreign program.
				When downloading, if there is still a conflict between the Reyvateil and the Hymmnos Extract,
				the Reyvateil may refuse to allow the download to complete, or the downloaded program may be
				unusable.

			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ The design of Hymmnos Extract</div>
			<p>
				EXEC_PAJA/. is a chant registered with a Tower that runs a function of the system; it is
				communicated using a Reyvateil's feelings (H-waves).
				Technically, the Hymmnos chant was downloaded (memorized) and the Reyvateil (daughter
				(<i>of the tower</i> -ed)) sang it.
				What the Reyvateil has done is much the same as how a device controller reads the data
				from a DVD.
				To explain this in more technical terms, the Reyvateil's song, which sent a message via
				the wave-spectrum of her feelings (H-waves), was generated by a CPU-like component that
				used a bus to access her memory, allowing for control over things like the bandwidth and
				resolution of the retrieved data (<i>which, perhaps, accounts for differences between
				identical Hymmnos Extracts sung by different Reyvateils</i> -ed).
				A table that summarizes this relationship is presented below.

				Expressed in terms of real-world technology, H-waves are like program instructions, and
				D-waves are used to show the results on a screen.

			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ The relationship of power and H-wave emission</div>
			<p>
				The H-waves associated with Hymmnos Words, in some cases, may be omitted without affecting the
				results of a chant; because the sound of such Hymmnos may resonate with Sound Stones, the singing
				itself may lead to the intended result without the intervention of a Tower. (And, given the
				nature of Hymmnos Words, there is no reason why the related H-waves would necessarily be
				meaningful).
				Intuitively, given that humans can use them, Hymmnos Spells do not involve H-waves.
				Hymmnos Extracts, however, offer the Reyvateil no freedom with regard to H-wave generation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hymmnos Extract relies on foreign feelings, which denies the singer the ability to use
				her own discretion to control the flow of H-waves.
				This is best explained by contrast: consider the Hymmnos Words of EXEC_HYMME_LIFE_A:W:S/.,
				as sung by Aurica; when she begins, she subconsciously determines the spectrum and flow
				of the H-waves she emits. However, when she sang the Hymmnos Extract EXEC_LINCA/.,
				the H-wave flow required to establish the connection was pre-determined and, therefore,
				beyond her control.
				From this example, you should observe that singing Hymmnos Extract requires a Reyvateil
				to be able to meet Extract-specific minimum levels of flow and spectrum.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, these demands have the potential for tragedy: it should be apparent that
				Hymmnos Extract places extreme demands upon the powers of a Reyvateil, much moreso than
				any other form of invoked Hymmnos.
				Second-generation Reyvateils (β-Reyvateils) generally have no problems meeting the requirements
				of these chants: being, fundamentally, clones of the Origin, their powers all satisfy identical
				minimum standards, allowing for the neat separation of Hymmnos Extract into two categories:
				Origin-exclusive and general-purpose for the &quot;pure-blooded β-types&quot;.
				(Note: In the Second Era of Sol Ciel, pure-blooded β-types were enhanced, providing some with powers
				that rivaled, and possibly even surpassed, those of Origins)
				The problem arises with the third generation, which offers no minimum guarantees regarding
				abilities. Because of this, those of the third generation who would invoke Hymmnos Extract
				place themselves at great risk of dying under the stress of the demands placed upon them.
			</p>
			<p>
				As ironic fortune, the fact that the third generation lacks Hymn Codes prevents them from
				using the more dangerous Hymmnos Extracts.
