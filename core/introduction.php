			<p>
				The grammar of Hymmnos is based on a number of abstract, complex concepts.
				To understand it, it is best to approach the language as though it were a science:
				begin with basic, observable ideas and build upon them incrementally.
				In this section, some such basic ideas will be outlined.
				Note that this collection is by no means comprehensive, and it may be outdated as
				new information is provided through its interactive video game counterparts.

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Conducted waves</div>
				<p>
					As sound, the waves that carry Hymmnos Words often need to propagate to have any
					effect on the world. Just like heat, light, and every other type of waveform,
					the magic waves of Hymmnos typically need to be conducted through matter.
				</p>

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Stationary waves</div>
				<p>
					Stationary waves are a somewhat more complicated concept.
					Using an arbitrary example -- and, really, there can be no non-arbitrary examples here --
					consider a pencil. For it to continue to be a pencil, the forces that keep it coherent
					must maintain a certain balance; effectively, the forces of the universe have gathered
					tiny components that have coalesced into something we recognize as a pencil.
					These forces, and, indeed, the matter that they act upon, can be expressed as waves, and
					it is the interaction all of these waves that form the stationary wave structure we
					perceive as a pencil.
				</p>
				<p>
					Akira Tsuchiya, the expert on Hymmnos theory, offers this analogy for those with a
					background in physics: stationary waves are like a collection of atoms. Normally,
					individual atoms scatter throughout their environment, but when enough start to bind to
					each other, stable molecules form. Stationary waves are like molecules in that they do not
					disperse on their own, remaining stable until acted on by an outside force.

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">D-wave</div>
				<p>
					<span style="color: red;">
						The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie_hypothesis">de Broglie hypothesis</a>
						and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality">wave-particle duality</a>
						hold that all matter has a wave-like nature. The world of Ar_tonelico takes some liberties
						with advancing and departing from the physics behind these concepts, so just accept that
						is presented is a reasonable translation of Akira Tsuchiya's transcribed imaginings and
						<b>not</b> material that should go on your next term paper.

				</p>
				<p>
					Matter-waves are referred to as &quot;<b>D</b>etail-waves&quot;.<br/>
					Take, for example, metals.
					Differences can be observed as the frequencies acting on them vary between 0Hz and ∞Hz --
					these differences are not reflected directly in terms of their fundamental shape, but rather
					through physical phenomena, such as melting because of high temperatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					The terms &quot;wave-type&quot; and &quot;wave-state&quot; are often used to describe
					D-waves, being expressed interchangably with &quot;conducted D-wave&quot; and
					&quot;stationary D-wave&quot;. The rough relationship between them is that conducted
					D-waves affect stationary D-waves, like exciting the particles in water to cause it
					to boil.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">H-wave</div>
				<p>
					Throught-waves are referred to as &quot;<b>H</b>ymmno-waves&quot;.<br/>
					These waves cannot be explained through analogies related to physical matter; they are,
					in essence, waves that carry feelings and the intent of thoughts.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				D-waves and H-waves are transmitted via entirely different spectra, so they do not interfere
				with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				At present, the researchers of Sol Ciel have not been able to prove that D-waves and H-waves
				exist alone. With the infinite range of wave-spectra, an infinite number of wave-type
				varieties may exist.
