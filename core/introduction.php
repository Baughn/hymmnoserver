			<p>
				The grammar of Hymmnos is based on a number of abstract, complex concepts.
				To understand it, it is best to approach the language as though it were a science:
				begin with a number of basic, observable ideas and build upon them incrementally.
				In this section, some of those basic ideas will be outlined; this collection is
				by no means comprehensive, and it may be outdated as new information is provided
				through its interactive video game counterparts.

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Conducted waves</div>
				<p>
					As sound, the waves that carry Hymmnos Words often need to propagate to have any
					effect on the world. Just like heat, light, and every other type of waveform,
					the magic waves of Hymmnos typically need to be conducted through matter.
				</p>

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Stationary waves</div>
				<p>
					Stationary waves are a somewhat more difficult concept to grasp.
					In essence, they form when enough Hymmnos force has been collected in one location to
					maintain coherence by itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Akira Tsuchiya, the expert on Hymmnos theory, offers this analogy for those with a
					background in physics: it is like a collection of atoms. Normally, atoms would scatter
					throughout their environment, but when enough start to bind to each other, stable
					molecules form. Stationary waves are like molecules in that they do not disperse on
					their own, remaining stable until acted on by an outside force.

				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">D-wave</div>
				<!-- I really had to stretch to make sense of this one. Sorry, purists. -->
				<p>
					Matter-waves are referred to as &quot;<b>D</b>etail-waves&quot;.<br/>
					All matter in this world is composed of waves. Take, for example, metals.
					Differences can be observed as the frequencies acting on them vary anywhere between 0 and ∞Hz --
					not so much in their fundamental shape, but through physical phenomena, such as melting as a
					result of high temperatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					D-waves tend to influence the physical world because they affect the "sea" of waves that
					define perceived reality. The concepts of a specific type of D-wave and the state of the
					"sea" are often considered together.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">H-wave</div>
				<p>
					Throught-waves are referred to as &quot;<b>H</b>ymmno-waves&quot;.<br/>
					These waves cannot be explained using properties related to physical matter; they are,
					in essence, waves that carry feelings.
					Where D-waves reflect the willfulness of the spirit, H-waves are expressions of the soul.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				D-waves and H-waves are transmitted via entirely different spectra, so they do not interfere
				with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				At present, the researchers of Sol Ciel have not been able to prove that D-waves and H-waves
				exist alone. With the infinite range of wave-spectra, an infinite number of wave-type
				varieties may exist.
