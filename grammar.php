			<p>
				Hymmnos, described as the &quot;language of emotions&quot;, has, as its most prominent
				feature, a sentence structure that focuses on expressing the speaker's feelings.
				Because it is focused on the speaker's feelings, statements nominally flow from a
				first-person perspective. As with so many other things, perhaps it will be easiest to
				understand how Hymmnos differs from other languages by looking at an example:
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr style="font-size: 12pt;">
					<td class="hymmn1">Was</td>
					<td class="hymmn1">yea</td>
					<td class="hymmn1">ra</td>
					<td class="hymmn2">chs</td>
					<td class="hymmn2">hymmnos</td>
					<td class="hymmn2">mea</td>
				</tr>
				<tr style="font-weight: bold;">
					<td class="kanji1" colspan="3">Emotion Sound</td>
					<td class="kanji2">verb</td>
					<td class="kanji2">object</td>
					<td class="kanji2">object</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="kanji1" colspan="3">great, enjoyable happiness<br/>(I am delighted)</td>
					<td class="kanji2">become</td>
					<td class="kanji2">song</td>
					<td class="kanji2">me</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				
				This sample sentence means &quot;I am delighted to express myself through song,&quot;
				conveyed with an expression of genuine joy by the speaker.

				<span class="text-title-small">&lt;Effects of Emotion Sounds&gt;</span><br/>
				Even when speaking the same core sentence, the meaning conveyed by a speaker
				whose emotional state is cool and collected may be wildly different from the
				meaning conveyed by a speaker who indicates seething anger.
				Some Hymmnos used to control Towers have different effects depending on the
				Emotion Words with which they are spoken.
				For example, a command used to open a door may receive a faster response if
				the emotional context with which it is delivered indicates desperation rather
				than calmness.
			</p>
			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Prescriptive syntax</div>
			<p>
				In the example above, although the word for &quot;me&quot; was used as a noun,
				it was not an indicator of narrative perspective. The nominal form of Hymmnos
				is first-person, which is logical because it is a language primarily centred
				around conveying the emotions of its speaker. However, structures do exist
				that allow statements to be expressed in terms of second- and third-person
				narrative perspectives, and these will be discussed shortly.
			</p>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">General sentence structure</div>
				<p>
					<b>[Emotion Sound]-[verb]-[compound]</b> [VC]<br/>
					<b>[Emotion Sound]-[verb]-[object]-[compound]</b> [VOC]<br/>
					In our example sentence, &quot;Was yea ra chs hymmnos mea,&quot; the Emotion
					Sound is &quot;Was yea ra,&quot; the verb is &quot;chs,&quot; the first object is
					&quot;hymmnos,&quot; and the variable component is another object, &quot;mea&quot;.
				</p>
				<p>
					Compounds may be any structure satisfying [nil/O/VC/VOC], which means that sentences
					may be infinitely long, provided they continue to make use of nested compounds.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">External-perspective sentence structure</div>
				<p>
					<b>[Emotion Sound]-[verb]-rre-[subject]-[verb]-[compound]</b><br/>
					<b>[Emotion Sound]-[verb]-rre-[subject]-[verb]-[object]-[compound]</b><br/>
					In this case, the sentence structure is [VSV'C/VSV'OC].<br/><br/>
					The first verb, [V], indicates the speaker's action, and the second verb, [V'], indicates
					the subject's action.
				</p>
				<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
					<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">&quot;rre&quot;, the subject identifier</div>
					<p>
						Because Hymmnos does not nominally have an explicit subject, it has need of a special
						subject-identifier; this identifier is &quot;rre&quot;.
					</p>
					<p>
						When &quot;rre&quot; appears before an object, that object becomes the subject of the
						sentence. However, regardless of any shifts in subject, the sentence's Emotion Sound is
						relative only to the speaker.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
					<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Pronoun alternatives to &quot;rre&quot;</div>
					<p>
						Subject-form pronouns may be used in place of a &quot;rre-[subject]&quot; component.
						Hymmnos's pronouns extend those found in English by accounting for gender and quantity.
					</p>

				</div>
				<p>
					This may be obvious, but no sentence may contain more than one subject, so &quot;rre&quot;
					or its equivalents may appear only once, precluding changes of focus in compounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Historically, non-first-person sentences were not part of standard Hymmnos; it was not
					until the formation of Central Standard Note that &quot;rre&quot; formally became part of
					the language to further its communicability.

			<div class="section-title text-title-small">⠕ Persistent Emotion Sounds definition syntax</div>
			<p>
				This section describes a structure that allows an Emotion Sound to be applied to an arbitrarily
				large collection of sentences. This is important because it prevents a speaker from having to
				continually express their emotions before every sentence in a series of related statements,
				such as a stanza in a hymn.
			</p>
<!-- Be very, very careful when editing this block. Do not adjust the alignment
of these lines; they are offset by fake spaces, and writing inline CSS to
duplicate the effect would be very tedious -->
			<p>
　<b>Ma num ra 0x vvi.</b> [Emotion sound (&quot;Ma num ra&quot;) BEGIN]<br/>
　　　<b>・</b> [any number of sentences in Hymmnos]<br/>
　　<b>(Hymmnos sentence)</b><br/>
　　　<b>・</b> [any number of sentences in Hymmnos]<br/>
　<b>1x AAs ixi.</b> [END]
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that, between the statements &quot;0x vvi.&quot; and &quot;1x AAs ixi.&quot;,
				every sentence will bear the Emotion Sound &quot;Ma num ra&quot;.
				0 and 1 are, of course, binary flags; as qualified numbers, &quot;0x&quot; is pronounced as
				&quot;o ku&quot;, and, likewise, &quot;1x&quot; as &quot;i ku&quot;.

			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Emotionless sentences</div>
				<p>
					Emotion Sounds, and, optionally, the initial verb, may be omitted from sentences, even
					when they are not part of a persistent Emotion Sound sequence, leading to [VC/VOC].<br/>
					When Hymmnos is spoken in this manner, it will not be processed by Towers,
					making it little more than a spoken, though highly melodious, language.
				</p>
				<p>
					Emotionless sentences may adopt a subject other than the speaker if they are
					presented in [SVC/SVOC] format. (In this case, the &quot;rre&quot; is optional)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style="padding-left: 10px;">
				<div class="subsection-title text-title-small">Overriding Emotion Sounds</div>
				<p>
					Although sentences expressed within the context of a persistent Emotion Sound sequence
					already bear Emotion Sounds by definition, it is possible to explicitly change the
					Emotion Sound associated with a specific sentence by prefixing it with another;
					explicitly specified Emotion Sounds always take priority.
					Doing this saves the speaker the trouble of ending one persistent sequence for
					a single sentence, only to have to begin another sequence immediately afterwards.
